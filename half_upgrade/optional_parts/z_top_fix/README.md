# Z Top Fix

There is an issue on original Z axis rod where the Z rod are neither parallel nor perpendicular ! More details here : https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/34

This z axis top solve the problem plus it makes the bracket stronger and it increases the Z smooth rod fixation. The dimensions are optimized for PETG filament.

It is compatible with Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s and MK2.5.

## Updates :
* version 1.1 : increase threaded rod hole diameter
* version 1.2 : reduce hexagon hole and add little chamfer. this helps fitting accessories in this hole
* version 2.0 : improve smooth rod hole, add selective infill, improve print settings
* version 2.1 : fix issue with smooth rod length


## Print Settings
It is important to follow those print settings due to the selective infill technique
* 30% infill
* 0.2mm layers
* 3 perimeters
* 5 tops and bottoms
* no support, no raft
* slic3r PE
* Optimized for PETG

Use PETG or ABS filament.I am using [Extrudr MF-PETG Neon Orange](https://extrudr.eu/collections/petg/products/extrudr-mf-petg-neon-orange) which is very very close to Prusa orange.

Might be good to reduce the speed a bit because of the small surface on the end of the print.
