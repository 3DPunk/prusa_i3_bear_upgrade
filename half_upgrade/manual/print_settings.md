# Prusa i3 Bear Half Upgrade

## Print Settings

### /!\ Warning /!\

There are several hidden features on most printed parts (like selective infill). This is why you should really stick to the parameters below and use slic3r Prusa Edition to slice them.

To ensure your prints are good, be sure to have a very well calibrated machine and extruder.


### Parameters

All those parts are optimized for PETG. If you print in ABS you might end up with too small all due to shrinkage.
