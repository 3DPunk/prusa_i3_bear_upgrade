## What's new in v2.0 ?

* Now use M5x12mm on Y motor mount (instead of M5x15mm) to easily remove all motor screws when tightened to the frame
* Improved manual
* Stronger rod holders (and use less plastics)
* PSU lower mount not use pockets for nuts to ease assembly
* Feet use M5x12 as well
* Nicer LCD supports
* Minor improvements for better printing quality and durability

## Manual

The manual contains build of material, preparing frame and v-slots, print settings and assembly instructions.

[Read it here](manual/)


## Modify the original aluminum frame

With this upgrade you will need to drill the original frame of your Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s or MK2.5.

I have made a [3D printed part](printed_parts/stl/drilling_helper.stl) to help you place the holes accurately. You can double check the positions with [this PDF](doc/frame_drilling_dimensions.pdf).

As you will see in the bill of material, the recommended drill bit is a 5.3mm.

If you break the frame, you can send an email to Prusa support to get a new one. You will find few in the Chinese market as well.

If you have access to a CNC machine, you can use [this DXF here](optional_parts/alu_frame/).


## Getting Openbuilds V-Slots

The length of V-Slots are detailed [here](doc/vslots_length.pdf).
