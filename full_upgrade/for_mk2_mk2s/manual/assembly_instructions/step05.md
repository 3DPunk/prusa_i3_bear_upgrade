## Assembly Instructions

### Step 5

#### Parts  

* 1x 290mm v-slot
* 2x 356mm v-slots
* 6x 90° joining plates
* 18x M5x10mm screws
* 18x Tee nuts

#### Assembly

1. File sharp edges on the diagonal of 2x 90° joining plates. A small chamfer is enough, this just to avoid scratching cables
1. Assemble 2x 356mm v-slots with 1x 290mm v-slot as seen on figure 5.1 (with 2x 90° joining plates, 10x M5x10 screws and 10x tee nuts)
1. Check all dimensions as seen on figure 5.2<br>
   :warning: this step is very important, double check everything is perfectly square
1. File **all** sharp edges of 4x latest 90° joining plates (not only diagonals). A small chamfer is enough, this just to avoid scratching cables and it will be useful for the next step as well
1. Assemble the 4x latest 90° joining plates as seen on figure 5.3
