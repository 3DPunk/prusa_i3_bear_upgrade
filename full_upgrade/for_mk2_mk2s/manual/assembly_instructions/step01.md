## Assembly Instructions

### Step 1

#### Parts

* 2x 331mm V-Slots
* 2x 370mm V-Slots
* 1x 290mm V-Slots (used for distance reference)
* 4x 90° plates
* 16x M5x10mm screws
* 16x Tee nuts

#### Assembly

1. Assemble 4x 90° plates to the 2x 331mm v-slots as seen on figure 1.1 (with 8x M5x10 screws and 8x tee nuts). Do not tighten M5 screws yet
1. Add 1x 370mm v-slot vertically as seen on figure 1.2 (with 4x M5x10 screws and 4x tee nuts). Do not tighten M5 screws yet
1. Ensure the 290mm v-slot does not have sharp angle where it as been cut. We will use it as reference and it could mark your v-slots (specially black ones). If this is the case use a file to smooth a bit the sharp angles
1. Place the 290mm on the back between the 2x331mm v-slots as seen on figure 1.3. Ensure there is no space between rods.
1. Square and tight strongly the back (8x M5 screws). :warning: this step is very important, double check everything is perfectly square
1. Carefully remove the 290mm v-slot
1. Repeat step 4 and 5 to assemble the last 370mm v-slot as seen on figure 1.4. :warning: this step is very important, double check everything is perfectly square
1. Carefully remove the 290mm v-slot
1. :warning: Double check everything is perfectly square and aligned. Double check v-slots lengths. Double check that all screws have been strongly tightened
