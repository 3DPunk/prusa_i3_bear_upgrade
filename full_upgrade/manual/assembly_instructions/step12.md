# Assembly Instructions

## Step 12

### Parts

* 1x psu_lower_mount
* 2x M3x25 screws (from the original psu mount)
* 2x M3 washers (from the original psu mount)
* 2x M3 nuts (from the original psu mount)
* 2x M5x10

### Assembly

1. Assemble psu_lower_mount on the PSU with 2 M3x25, 2 nuts and 2 washers. Do not tight them too much, the psu_lower_mount should move freely (will be tight after) (fig 12.1)
2. Bolt 2 M5x10 to the tee nuts, tight strongly to the frame (fig 12.2)
3. Finish to tight the M3 screws (fig 12.2)
