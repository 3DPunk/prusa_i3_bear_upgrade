# Prusa i3 Bear Upgrade v2.0

This is an aluminum frame conversion for the Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s and MK2.5.

Josef PRŮŠA has created numerous of incredible 3D printers and its Prusa i3 MK3 is capable of very impressive print quality for a very low price. A huge thanks to him and all its team!

Prusa i3 MK3 has a much better frame than its predecessors but the Z axis is still not enough rigid. A very good project has solved those problems by using 3030 extrusion aluminum : Prusa 3030 Haribo Edition. So why another conversion build? Check the next section ;)


## Why another conversion build?

* To reduce the number of parts to update from your original printer (no need to print a new RAMBo/EINSY cover nor change any cable, rods or firmware update)
* Use more aluminum and less printed parts to build the frame (3D printed parts can crack if tighten too strongly, they are less reliable, less precise and might cost more
* Compatible with MK2, MK2s MK2.5 and MK3 printers
* Use Openbuilds hardware:
  * To have a single high quality platform of multitude compatible hardware parts (extrusion, plates, brackets, low profile screws...)
  * V shape gives more possibilities to orientate the printed part (45° angle is more than manageable, with T-Slots you might need to add support)
  * Open source
  * Easy to square and build
  * Worldwide shipping plus several other shops selling these parts
  * Powerful community
  * Easily customizable
* Limited number of measurements needed during the build phase (and no need for a calliper bigger than 150mm)
* Fully open source by providing STL files, STEP files and Autodesk Fusion 360 project file
* Better design of 3D printed parts using selective infill, material saving, clean vertical holes...


## Compatibility

This upgrade is compatible with Original Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s MK2.5 and MK3 printers.

## Getting Openbuilds V-Slots

The length of V-Slots are detailed [here](doc/vslots_length.pdf).

### On-line shops

Here is a list of [Openbuilds stores](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade/blob/master/doc/openbuilds_stores_list.md).

### Pre-cut

In the list above you will find indication about pre-cut V-Slots for each shops. If a store in your country does not sell pre-cut V-Slots, try to send an email.

### Machine cut

The best way to cut V-Slots is to use a mitre saw with special aluminum blade and lubricant.

Another way is to use a circular saw but you will need a cross-cut sled. As well as for mitre saw, a special aluminum blade and lubricant are necessary.

### Hand cut

You can hand cut them accurately using a jig (it just takes more time and effort). I have build one, all details are here : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2596242
