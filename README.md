# Prusa i3 Bear Edition

Josef PRŮŠA has created numerous of incredible 3D printers and its latest Prusa i3 MK2s is capable of very impressive print quality for a very low price. A huge thanks to him and its team!

However, I don't find the frame strong enough, it is very difficult to square, it is not rigid enough on the Z axis and finaly the frame might move a bit when you do some maintenance. A very good project has solved those problems by using 3030 extrusion aluminum : Prusa 3030 Haribo Edition. But I am convinced that we can go further (number of parts to update, more aluminum and less printed parts...)!

## So what makes this project better ?
* reuse most of the Prusa i3 MK2s parts (you don't need to print a new RAMBo cover nor change any cable or rods from the original Prusa i3 MK2s)
* use open source high quality Openbuilds hardware (extrusion, plates, brackets, low profile screws...)
* use only aluminum parts to build the frame (3D printed parts can crack if tighten too strongly, they are less reliable and less precise)
* fully open source (stl files, step files and Autodesk Fusion 360 project are available)
* easy to customize thanks to Openbuilds hardware
* widely available hardware

## Current status

I am at the begining of this project, version 0.1 is out with a printer that should be functional but I couldn't mount it.

Some parts still need to be designed:
* spool holder
* LCD screen brackets

## Sources

Here are a list of sources I used to build this project :

* Prusa : http://www.prusa3d.com/
* Prusa 3030 Haribo Edition : https://github.com/PrusaMK2Users/3030_Haribo_Edition

Huge thanks to these projects, without them this project can not exist!
