# Prusa i3 Bear Upgrade

This is an aluminum frame conversion for the Prusa i3 MK2, MK2s and MK2.5.

Josef PRŮŠA has created numerous of incredible 3D printers and its Prusa i3 MK2/MK2s/MK2.5 is capable of very impressive print quality for a very low price. A huge thanks to him and all its team!

Unfortunately, the frame is the weakest point of the machine. It is very difficult to square, it is not rigid enough on the Z axis and finaly the frame might move a bit when you do some maintenance. A very good project has solved those problems by using 3030 extrusion aluminum : Prusa 3030 Haribo Edition. 

## So why another conversion build?
* To reduce the number of parts to update from Prusa i3 MK2/MK2s/MK2.5 kit (no need to print a new RAMBo cover nor change any cable, rods or firmware from the original Prusa i3 MK2/MK2s/MK2.5)
* Use more aluminum and less printed parts to build the frame (3D printed parts can crack if tighten too strongly, they are less reliable, less precise and might cost more)
* Use Openbuilds hardware:
  * To have a single high quality platform of multitude compatible hardware parts (extrusion, plates, brackets, low profile screws...)
  * Open source
  * Easy to square and build
  * Worldwide shipping plus several other shops selling these parts
  * Powerfull community
  * Easily customizable
* Limited number of measurements needed during the build phase (and no need for a caliper bigger than 150mm)
* Fully open source by providing STL files, STEP files and Autodesk Fusion 360 project file
